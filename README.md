# Welcome to our serverless study repository hub

To make the introduction, I'm a software engineering student who colaborate with a multidisciplinar team from DXC company. We are interested on serverless architectures and have the objetive to aport some value researching obout the topic.

In a first instance, the research is focus on the migration of microservices architectures onto serverless. We are aware that many developers are facing the trouble that supose migrate legacy software, and we want to give some advices or kind of guidelines for them (always based on our experience, experiments, and the researched knowledgement)

The repositories of the built solutions are the following:
